# SudokuSolver
**C# console app for solving sudoku puzzles**

Sudoku is my go-to game while on airplanes.  Typically, the puzzles in the magazines on airplanes are partially filled in by the time I get to them.  This frustrates me a bit.  If you're going to mess it up by writing in it, at least fill it in all the way.  I'd rather see it filled in brokenly than have wild and obvious gaps showing.  Strange, I know, but that's me.

In any case, these puzzles are not worth doing.  However, I think it would be fun to not waste any time on them but at least fill them in correctly.  In order to do that, I need to either:

1. Get _lots_ better at solving them in my head, because the page is already messed up, or...
2. Feed the initial numbers into a solver and have it spit out the answers for me so I can use my fine-tipped Sharpie to fill in all the right numbers.

So, here's my Sudoku Solver.  I'll keep a log in the commits on how it evolves.
